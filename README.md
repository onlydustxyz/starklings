# Environment setup

This repository uses [nile](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile) as CLI tool.

First you need to install python3.8. You can install it using your favorite package manager, or install it in a virtual environment using [conda](https://conda.io/).

## Using conda
Install conda following the instructions on [the website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Then create a dedicated virtual environment and activate it

```bash
conda create -n onboarding python=3.8
conda activate onboarding
```

## Not using conda
If you don't use Conda, you need to create a virtualenv and activate it this way:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

# How to use this repo

This tutorial has 2 difficulty levels: basic, advanced.

Please checkout the wanted branch to get started:

```bash
git switch basic
# or
git switch advanced
```

# Advance workshop

## First two easy exercise to better understand this workshop

`contracts/ex` contrains two exercises with instructions on what to do.
Run `pytest tests/test_ex00.py` and `pytest tests/test_ex01.py` and code until the tests pass.

Those two contracts (at least our implementations of those) are used to power the game engine you will be interacting with later on.

## Initial configuration

Once you have activated your virtual environment, install the required dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # will install cairo-nile
nile install # Will install all required dependencies to build/test/deploy starknet contracts
```

## Deploy

First, start a local node:
```bash
nile node
```

Then, deploy the contracts:
```bash
nile run scripts/deploy.py
```

Keep the addresses of the contracts, you'll need them later.

## Goal

Implement your ship to catch as much dust as possible.

## Get started

To add your ship, compile it and deploy it
```bash
nile compile
nile deploy <my-ship-contract>
```

Then, add the ship to the game's space
```bash
nile invoke <space-contract-address> add_ship <x> <y> <ship-contract-address>
```

Finally, call `next_turn` to let the game computes the next turn
```bash
nile invoke <space-contract-address> next_turn
```
